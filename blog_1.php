                        <h3>Maintenance Planning and Daily Maintenance Tasks :-
                        </h3>
                        <p>Preventative maintenance is the practice of undertaking measures to avoid failures and
                          breakdowns by preventing misuse, physical damage and wear. It is a good practice to inspect
                          your plant in order to discover any of these issues before they cause a serious problem. A
                          preventative maintenance package should include inspections and necessary repairs, replacement
                          of worn components, adjustment and calibration. In order to accurately plan preventative
                          maintenance tasks you need to know what the expected life span of each component is in your
                          system. The goal with preventative maintenance is not just repair work but also pro-active
                          replacement or repair to extend service life for as long as possible.
                        </p>
                        <p>Plan your preventative maintenance tasks based on the anticipated age of each component and
                          the possible failure modes. Learning about each of these, you can then develop replacement
                          strategies for all components including acquiring spare parts throughout the warranty period.
                          If your plan is to replace a component due to expected wear, then now is the time to buy and
                          gather replacement parts for all components in your plant.
                        </p>

                        <h3>Daily Maintenance Tips for Your Industrial Plant :-
                        </h3>
                        <p>Daily maintenance tasks are also known as system daily tasks and operate within a plant's
                          primary maintenance window, i.e., when it is too risky to perform major repairs or replace key
                          components but before shutdowns and other costly consequences can occur. To perform daily
                          tasks safely and effectively, it is important to have a clear understanding of the
                          vulnerabilities and limitations of your plant's equipment.
                        </p>

                        <h3>Outages and Unplanned Maintenance :-
                        </h3>
                        <p>Plants are susceptible to downtime due to unplanned maintenance and any possible failure of
                          equipment. This is especially true with nuclear, coal, oil and gas plants that may experience
                          a sudden shutdown due to a damaging failure. A thorough understanding of the cause of the
                          outage can determine if it can be avoided in future and prevent significant loss if a similar
                          event occurs again.
                        </p>

                        <p>Unplanned maintenance usually occurs due to human error and improper operation of equipment
                          that causes damage to equipment or shutdown of the plant due to overheating. It is important
                          for your plant's team members to know what actions could be taken in order to prevent an
                          outage from happening again or at least minimize its impact on your revenue streams.
                        </p>

                        <h3>Common Causes of Disruptions during Daily Maintenance :-
                        </h3>
                        <p>Technical and Other Events are often caused by or are the reason for unplanned outages. The
                          first step is to identify the root cause of the event (whether human error or a machine
                          failure) by reviewing and analyzing your plant's operating parameters. Once you have
                          identified all possible causes, it would be important to understand their impact on the plant
                          operations. This way you can try to avoid them in future and predict their cost and duration
                          in order to minimize their impact on any revenue stream, i.e., production, maintenance or
                          safety.
